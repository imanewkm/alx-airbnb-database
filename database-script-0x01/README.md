# ALX Airbnb Database - Database Schema

## Objective

The objective of this project is to write SQL queries to define the database schema by creating tables and setting appropriate constraints.

## Instructions

1. **Understand the Specification**: Review the provided database specification to identify the entities and their relationships.
2. **Create Tables**: Write SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements for each entity in the database.
3. **Define Constraints**:
    - Use appropriate data types for each column.
    - Define primary keys to uniquely identify records.
    - Set up foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
    - Add other constraints (e.g., `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`) as needed.
4. **Optimize Performance**:
    - Create indexes on columns that are frequently queried to improve performance.

## Deliverables

- SQL scripts containing the `CREATE TABLE` statements with all constraints and indexes properly defined.

## Notes

- Ensure the schema adheres to normalization principles.
- Test the SQL scripts to verify correctness and integrity of the database schema.
